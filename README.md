# What is S2B?

School Staging Bundle (S2B), not affiliated with SNO, intends to replicate internal API functionality of various SNO
products. Central Times uses S2B on its staging environment for app development.
`wp_s2b` is installed as a Wordpress plugin and provides these internal APIs for access in other plugins.

# Scope

`wp_s2b` will implement all internal APIs necesary for the continued operation and development of the
[Central Times Wordpress Plugin](https://github.com/CentralTimes/wp_centraltimes) on
the [Staging Times](https://staging.centraltimes.org/) staging website.

`wp_s2b` **DOES NOT** intend to be a replacement for SNO's products, and instead acts as a minimal placeholder for the
APIs that SNO's products provide.
